# About oFxTemplate

This template is the simplest possible openFrameworks app! It does nothing.

The template is great for making sure that your openFrameworks development environment is compiling properly. It can also be useful as a "starter template" for making simple programs.

The emptyExample will help you understand what are the bare necessities of an openFrameworks program. In this regard, you can think of it as a "Hello World" for OF.
